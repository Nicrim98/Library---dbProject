# Library---dbProject

Project created with my friend Kuba for databases class at the university.

We used in project python language as well as html, JavaScript, CSS.
The database was created in pgAdmin 4. It is very simple but it shows basic functionality.

To launch the program, You should open 'bibliotek.py' code and click 'Run'. Propably You will be asked to download some packages to run it. If You succeed, the website of our library shows.
